# Odoo 10.0 - Technical Training

This repository contains training material for learning Odoo 10.
It is split into modules, each module focusing on a given topic.
Each module provides some reference material, and proposes problems for the learnee to solve.
It is therefore a hands-on, practical approach to the development of Odoo modules.
