Questions Monday

    How do you access the odoo shell ?

    'shell' parameter without '--'

    How can we execute directly sql queries from the code?

    Is it possible to visualize database records into Odoo ?

    How to test the freshly created model with some mockup/demo data ?

    see "demo data xml" example: library_data.xmlf

    configure in "__manifest__.py"

    possible to use "noupdate" attribute in xml <data "noupdate"=1>

    Is it possible to physically remove columns from a table with Python?

    automatic when a column is not used anymore at the ORM level

    Does Odoo have a possibility to backup local database and in case of emergency return to specified date?



Questions Tuesday

    Are there other specific fields like 'currency'. For example an 'email' field with email validation ?

    Yes, there is a widget "email" which is a simple Char field without client validation nor server validation.

    The only thing it does is changing the display to a clickable "mailto" link.

    You have to use a regex constraint at the ORM level (raise a validation error)

    Is there some documentation or list about available widgets ?

    Yes, in source code : addons/web/static/src/js/views/form_widgets.js

    Is it necessary to use form view to create or update data? Can we do it from list view?

    Tree view has an "editable" attribute but it disable the form view. But treeview can have buttons that could open a formview

    If we can, is it possible to activate or desactivate form view for certain cases? (for example: we have a list view grouped by record.type and we click on button create)

    Does it exist certification for Odoo Partners ?



Questions Wednesday

    Is there a list of css attributes that we can use in the treeviews and friends ? (like "decoration-bf" ?)

    Odoo use bootstrap and we can use bootstrap styles

    Is it possible to modify the main layout (with CSS) ?

    Can we use the "xpath" method to update xml demo-data ? For example add data to a base res.partner demo data.

    No, impossible because it's not the same. xpath is used only in views inherita

    It's easier to use the same record-id as the original demo-data and the new fields will be added automatically.

    Can you help me install Odoo tomorrow morning if I have any issue?

    Can you re-explain the difference between xml id, id, etc. ?

    Where are the views and template stored? can we modify it through the shell ?

    Is there any documentation about how to use QWeb ?

    Yes, there is some drinkable doc at https://www.odoo.com/documentation/10.0/reference/qweb.html

    If we decide to use odoo community personally where can we define parameters like email server,  website address ..

    How can we use new fontawesome icon in the application and is it possible to choose icon color?

    They are all available in Odoo css styles


Question Thursday

    est-ce que tu pourrais réexpliquer la différence entre view_type et view_mode ?  et les différents types de décorations

    Is it possible to add button in header's tree view ?

    Is it possible to create an object without touching the database directly.

    Example:

    got = Book.create({ 'name' : 'Game of Thrones'})

    got.author = 'blabla'

    got.save() or got.commit() or... something else

    Yes, by using new

    If a unexisting group is specified in a security .csv file, will it be created at the starting time ?

    If someone with 'create' rights create a record but does not have 'write' rights, is he able to modify is own data ?

    No, he needs 'write'



Questions Friday
