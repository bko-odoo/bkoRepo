 
Git usage Odoo

    [IMP] for improvements
    [FIX] for bug fixes
    [REF] for refactoring
    [ADD] for adding new resources
    [REM] for removing of resources
    [MOV] for moving files (Do not change content of moved file, otherwise Git will loose track, and the history will be lost !), or simply moving code from a file to another one.
    [MERGE] for merge commits (only for forward/back-port)
    [CLA] for signing the Odoo Individual Contributor License

Exemple 
 [FIX] helpdesk: SLA ticket deadline

Calculation of ticket deadline based on SLA policy
and working days of resource(company)

Reason:
Ticket deadline was calculated just by adding SLA policy on ticket date
creation so deadline could be a date when company was closed.

git diff mybranch-baris..master => to see difference between my branch and master
	we can also do
git diff HEAD..HEAD^1 => to see difference between curent head and commit before
